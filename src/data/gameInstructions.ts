  'sudoku': {
    easy: 'Begin your Sudoku journey with confidence. Click on any empty cell and enter numbers 1-9. The game highlights your selected cell along with its row, column, and 3×3 box to help you see the constraints. Start with rows, columns, or boxes that already have many numbers filled in. Use simple scanning to find where numbers can only go in one place. The notes feature lets you mark possible numbers in each cell. Take your time and enjoy solving step by step.',
    medium: 'Step up your Sudoku skills with intermediate puzzles. Apply logical techniques like looking for naked pairs, hidden singles, and pointing pairs. Use the notes feature strategically to track candidates in each cell. Cross-reference rows, columns, and boxes to eliminate impossible numbers. Plan your moves carefully by analyzing how filling one cell affects nearby cells. Focus on cells with fewer candidates first. Work methodically through each region to maintain steady progress.',
    hard: 'Challenge yourself with advanced Sudoku puzzles. Master complex strategies including X-wings, swordfish, and box-line reduction patterns. Analyze multiple cells simultaneously to find hidden patterns. Every placement requires careful consideration of cascading effects across the entire grid. Use advanced noting techniques to track complex candidate chains. Think several moves ahead before committing to any number. Precision and patience are essential at this difficulty level.',
  },
  'cross-math': {
    easy: 'Start your CrossMath adventure with simple arithmetic. Click any empty cell and choose from the available numbers shown. Begin with equations that have just one or two empty cells. Focus on basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Remember that numbers can be used multiple times throughout the puzzle. Work on rows and columns separately at first. Check that each completed equation calculates correctly before moving to the next one.',
    medium: 'Advance to more challenging CrossMath puzzles. Pay attention to the order of operations—multiplication and division are calculated before addition and subtraction. Look for cells where horizontal and vertical equations intersect, as these provide helpful constraints. Plan ahead to ensure numbers work for both directions. Use logical deduction to eliminate impossible number combinations. Balance your focus between completing individual equations and solving the overall puzzle structure.',
    hard: 'Conquer complex CrossMath challenges with expert strategies. Master the complete order of operations with multiple nested calculations in each equation. Analyze how every number placement impacts all connected equations throughout the grid. Use systematic elimination to narrow down possibilities before testing solutions. Think strategically about the interaction between horizontal and vertical constraints. Verify each placement carefully as mistakes compound quickly at this difficulty.',
  },
  'number-ninja': {
    easy: 'Welcome to Number Ninja! Look for consecutive numbers that add up to your target sum at the top of the screen. Take your time spotting simple patterns and combinations. Build your confidence by finding multiple valid solutions quickly. Each successful combination increases your score multiplier. The timer is generous, giving you plenty of time to think through each level. Focus on accuracy first, then gradually work on speed.',
    medium: 'Enhance your Number Ninja abilities with faster gameplay. Recognize number patterns more quickly and plan your next combination while completing the current one. The timer becomes more challenging, requiring better time management. Balance speed with accuracy to maintain your combo streak and maximize multipliers. Target higher-value combinations when possible. Stay focused as the numbers increase in complexity and the pace picks up.',
    hard: 'Push your Number Ninja skills to the limit with intense challenges. Process complex number sequences instantly under significant time pressure. Chain multiple combinations flawlessly to achieve maximum score multipliers. Every fraction of a second counts as levels progress rapidly. Maintain razor-sharp focus while managing increasingly difficult targets. Master pattern recognition to spot solutions immediately. This difficulty demands peak performance and unwavering concentration.',
  },
  'kakuro': {
    easy: 'Welcome to Kakuro puzzles! Start with straightforward sum combinations and limited possibilities. Look for clues like "3 in two cells" which can only be 1+2. Fill in the obvious entries first where only one combination works. Remember that each sum group must use different digits from 1-9. Take your time understanding how horizontal and vertical sums intersect. Build your foundation with these simpler puzzles before advancing.',
    medium: 'Progress to intermediate Kakuro challenges requiring strategic thinking. Use cross-referencing between horizontal and vertical sums to narrow down possibilities systematically. Check which digits are already used in connected sum groups to eliminate options. Work with combinations that have multiple possible arrangements. Plan ahead to ensure your choices work for all intersecting sums. Develop your ability to see patterns across the entire grid.',
    hard: 'Master advanced Kakuro puzzles with complex overlapping constraints. Analyze multiple sum groups simultaneously to find the only valid solution. Use sophisticated elimination techniques considering all connected sums at once. Every digit placement must satisfy numerous constraints across horizontal and vertical groups. Think several steps ahead as choices in one area affect possibilities throughout the puzzle. Precision and systematic analysis are essential.',
  },
  'dots-match': {
    easy: 'Start connecting dots with simple path puzzles. Match dots of the same color by drawing lines between them. Begin with dots along the edges that have limited routing options. Remember that lines cannot cross each other or pass through other dots. Work gradually from the outside toward the center. Take your time planning each path to avoid blocking yourself. These early puzzles build your spatial reasoning skills.',
    medium: 'Take on more intricate Dots Match challenges with complex layouts. Plan your routes strategically by identifying bottleneck areas where multiple paths must pass through limited space. Consider the order of connections carefully—some dots must be linked first to leave room for others. Think two or three moves ahead before drawing any line. Develop your ability to visualize the complete solution. Balance immediate moves with long-term planning.',
    hard: 'Solve highly intricate Dots Match puzzles requiring expert planning. Visualize the complete solution layout before drawing your first line. Understand that one incorrect early path can make the entire puzzle impossible to complete. Work backwards from the most constrained connections to find the optimal routing solution. Analyze spatial relationships across the entire grid simultaneously. Every path must be perfect—there is no room for error.',
  },
  'nonogram': {
    easy: 'Discover the joy of Nonogram picture puzzles! Start with rows and columns that have large numbers or only one or two groups. Mark cells as filled or empty based on the number clues provided. Cross-reference rows and columns to confirm your deductions. The completed puzzle reveals a recognizable pixel art image. Take your time learning the basic logic patterns. These beginner puzzles introduce you to the fundamental solving techniques.',
    medium: 'Advance to more detailed Nonogram images requiring deeper analysis. Apply intermediate logic when clues are less obvious and have multiple possible arrangements. Pay close attention to how numbers indicate groups separated by at least one empty cell. Track multiple possibilities mentally until you can definitively eliminate incorrect options. The revealed images become more intricate and satisfying. Develop your logical reasoning and pattern recognition skills.',
    hard: 'Decode complex Nonogram puzzles with sophisticated logical deduction. Apply advanced techniques involving simultaneous analysis of multiple rows and columns. Work with edge cases where clue combinations have subtle but critical implications. One incorrect cell cascades into errors throughout the entire puzzle. The final images are highly detailed and rewarding. This difficulty demands exceptional logical thinking, patience, and precise analysis at every step.',
