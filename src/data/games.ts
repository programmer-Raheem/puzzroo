    about: 'Number Ninja is an exciting mathematical puzzle game that challenges your mental arithmetic and pattern recognition skills. Slice through numbers to reach target sums while racing against time. Perfect for players who love combining quick reflexes with strategic thinking, this game offers endless entertainment while sharpening your math abilities.',
    howToPlay: 'Start by selecting your difficulty level. Numbers will appear on the screen, and your goal is to combine them to reach the target sum displayed at the top. Swipe or click to select consecutive numbers that add up to your target. The faster you find combinations, the higher your score multiplier becomes. Each level increases in complexity with larger numbers and more challenging targets. Plan your moves carefully to create combos and maximize your points. Missing too many targets will end your game, so stay focused and think fast!',

    about: 'Sudoku is the world\'s most popular logic-based number puzzle. Fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3×3 section contains the numbers 1-9 without repetition. No math required - just pure logical deduction and strategic thinking. Perfect for developing concentration and problem-solving skills.',
    howToPlay: 'Click any empty cell to select it, then enter a number from 1-9. The game will highlight the selected cell\'s row, column, and 3×3 box to help you visualize constraints. Use the notes feature to mark potential candidates in each cell. As you progress, eliminate possibilities using logical deduction techniques like naked pairs, hidden singles, and box-line reduction. The puzzle is complete when all 81 cells are correctly filled. Invalid entries are automatically highlighted to help you catch mistakes.',

    about: 'Kakuro combines the logic of Sudoku with the arithmetic challenge of crosswords. Fill white cells with digits 1-9 to create sums that match the clues provided in triangular hint cells. Each sum must use unique digits, making this puzzle a perfect blend of mathematical reasoning and logical deduction.',
    howToPlay: 'Each clue shows the target sum and the number of cells that must add up to it. Click a white cell to enter a digit from 1-9. Remember that no digit can repeat within the same sum group. Use logical deduction to eliminate impossible combinations. For example, a sum of 3 in two cells can only be 1+2. Cross-reference horizontal and vertical constraints to narrow down your options. The puzzle is solved when all white cells are filled correctly and all sum clues are satisfied.',
